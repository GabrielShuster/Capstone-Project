## Problem and Background

<font size="5"> According to Straits Research, the Malaysian bubble tea market was valued at 49.8$ million in 2018 and is expected to grow 6.9 percant from 2018 to 2026. This proves to be both a promising future and an intresting dilema for bubble tea enthusiasts looking to start their own bubble tea buisness. As with any buisness bubble tea can become a very competitive field and especcialy in a place like Malaysia where proximity is very important due to the nature of their traffic system. Due to the combination of the increase in demand for bubbble tea leading to more buisness owners looking for opprutunities to open bubble tea stores, the competitve nature of the bubble tea system and the importance of location to the average bubbler tea consumer in Malaysia, I belive that using data science to determine the best position for a bubble tea shop in the capitol city of Malaysia Kuala Lumpur will bring in many different enterpeneurs looking for the prime locations that i can provide using the data. 

## Data

<font size="5"> I will only be needing 2 seperate data sources for this project. Firstly we will need a method of seperating different areas of the citys. At first my initial consideration was to seperate the city into a grid and give a analyisis based off proximity to downtown. However upon further consideration ive decided since im selling the data to local buisnessmen and buisnesswomen who grew up in the area they will have a better understanding of the data if we were to split it up by regions of the city. To find the various region names in Kuala Lumpur we can go to Wikipedia and head over to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Suburbs_in_Kuala_Lumpur and used beutiful soup to scrape the list of names into python. After that for the condensation of other buisnesses we used FourSquare data to identify other Bubble tea places in that neighbourhood
